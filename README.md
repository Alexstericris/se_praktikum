# SE Praktikum Group 6

Welcome to the repository of SE Praktikum Group 6! This project involves collaborative work on both the frontend and backend aspects to create a seamless and efficient software solution.

## Contributions

### Frontend

I mainly worked on the frontend, focusing on crafting the user interface and enhancing the overall user experience. The frontend is the face of our application, and my efforts were directed towards making it visually appealing and user-friendly.

### Backend

In addition to frontend work, I made significant contributions to the backend. Specifically, I worked on implementing and refining the routing logic. Routing is a crucial aspect of any web application, ensuring that users are directed to the appropriate pages and resources. My efforts aimed at optimizing this process for a smoother user journey.

I also dedicated time to writing tests for the backend functionality. Testing is essential to ensure the robustness and reliability of our software. By creating comprehensive tests, we can identify and address potential issues early in the development process.

###Ideas further development:

- Make a fullblown Rolemanagement Tool
- Learn Rxjs
- Try to implement Oauth
